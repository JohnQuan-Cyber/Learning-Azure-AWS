# Azure-Platform

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on Azure labs that I’m creating to deepen my understanding of cloud services, administration, and security. While completing my Cybersecurity and Network Technology diploma, I gained exposure to core Azure concepts, but there were many areas I didn’t have the chance to fully explore. These labs are my way of expanding that foundation and developing real, practical cloud experience.

* note:
I will be adding files that I used to learn more on the Azure platform here. For labs and projects, they will be having their own repositories.


# Azure Infrastructure Learning Lab
Period: January 2026

# What I learned this month
Fundamental cloud service models and Azure resource types (Resource Group, Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups, Virtual Machines)

Azure Portal navigation and resource management

Configuiring resources (Virtual Machines - Disks and sizes)

# January Notes

Week 1/2:

We are learning how to navigate throught the Azure Portal and deploy: Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, Network Security Groups (Subnets/Inbound rules/Outbound rules), Storages, Virtual Machines, Runbooks. 

Week 3:

As much as I liked the hands on labs and built some knowldege and practical skills, I did't particulary like how long it took to dpeloy these resources in the Portal interface. I really like the runbook and how to automate the task to start and stop a virtual machine. I wondered if I can automate other tasks 

Week 4:

At this point I'm really taking interest in the cloud course that we are learning. This is a path I want to take with networking and security 


# Azure Infrastructure Learning Lab
Period: February 2026

# What I learned this month
Build more practical skills through the labs (Blob Storage and Shares, Runbooks, Cost Estimation)

Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/ARM templates) principles and deployment through the Azure Portal

Using the CompTIA labs to learn more about Azure and AWS


# Febuary Notes

Week 1:

I'm currently learning through the Mircosoft Learn for the AZ 900 certification and the cloud course. I got to one module thats explaining about ARM templates and it was really intriguing but really confusing. I will be spending more time on this section.

I looked at other sources (YouTube and AI) just to further understand thes templates and then start trying to write them out on Visual Studio Code. As I was following a guide, I realize that the ARM extension is deprcated and to use the bicep extension.

In our labs this week I learned how to explore JSON code and understand what it is doing. Luckly with the previous Python course and DevOps course, it wasnt to hard. Ww also deployed the JSOn templates throught the Portal, but I wanted more of a challenge..

I've been practicing a lot on how to use bicep and deploy through the Azure CLI this past week and had this 'aha!' moment. There is this one video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yvb6NVx61Y from a channel called 'John Savill's Technical Training' that really help me understand what and how to use bicep.

I feel pretty confident in deploying the bicep and JSON file through the Azure commmand line. I will be practicing more each day adding a little more each time. 

Week 2:

Decided to create a few files (Enterprise.bicep files) to see if I can deploy the files through the CLI. It will be posted in a new branch called VSCode-Azure-CLI-Deployment
