# Azure-Platform

This repository contains a collection of hands‑on Azure labs that I’m creating to deepen my understanding of cloud services, administration, and security. While completing my Cybersecurity and Network Technology diploma, I gained exposure to core Azure concepts, but there were many areas I didn’t have the chance to fully explore. These labs are my way of expanding that foundation and developing real, practical cloud experience.

Janurary - April 2026 
I'm in my final term of school and one of my current courses for this repository is covering the CompTIA Cloud+ through their learn and lab platform. Not only that, we get to use the Azure for Student with the free credits after signing up and confirming our student statud. 

As for right now it, it will be heavily focused on Azure. I will be updating as much as I can. At some point I will cover some AWS as well

January 2026 - Week 1
